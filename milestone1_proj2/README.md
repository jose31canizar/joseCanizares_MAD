Scout

Scout is a course search engine that lets you search for courses at CU.

This app's intended audience will be college students at CU, but looking into the future, any University student. The problem I'm solving is how slow it is to look up courses and find out if they are worth taking, if other people found them easy or difficult, and if the professor teaches the course well.

It doesn't seem like there's a lot of Android apps out there that do this. There aren't any that do it specifically for CU that I could find. This would be very easy to get in the hands of CU students if put on the Play Store and promoted well.

The content needed for the app is really just the data receieved from fetch requests I will have to do. There should be an Android API that allows me to fetch data from a database I can set up on the Google Cloud Platform. I will be using the FCQ data the CU allows students to use.
