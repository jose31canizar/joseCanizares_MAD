# LightStack

LightStack is an app that lets users simplify their list keeping. People will feel organized and their lives will feel more structured with this simple tool.

People who feel disorganized or cluttered will use this app. This app will keep things they don't remember into a clean, archived list of items that are easily accessible with one tap. 

Similar apps that exist are the Notes app and Wunderlist. Both are basic list apps, but do not provide simplified gestures to interact with the list. I believe if the app supports many gestures, people will be attracted to that sense of immediacy which they need with a simple tool like this. 

Content for this app will not be required. The list stacks in whatever order the user leaves them in so there are no complex algorithms I need to use for that.
